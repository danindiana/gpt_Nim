Expand: Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming is a powerful feature in Nim that allows developers to write code that generates or manipulates other code at compile time. This capability enables the creation of domain-specific languages (DSLs), custom syntax extensions, and other advanced programming constructs. Here's a more detailed exploration of metaprogramming in Nim:

1. Macros
Macros are the primary mechanism for metaprogramming in Nim. They are functions that are executed at compile time and can generate or modify AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes. Macros can be used to create new syntax, transform code, or inject additional logic.

Example: Simple Macro
nim
Copy code
import macros

macro hello(name: static[string]): untyped =
  result = newLit("Hello, " & name & "!")

echo hello("World")  # Output: Hello, World!
In this example, the hello macro takes a static string parameter and generates a literal string at compile time.

2. AST Manipulation
Macros operate on the AST, which is a tree representation of the code. Developers can inspect, create, and modify AST nodes to achieve the desired transformations.

Example: AST Inspection
nim
Copy code
import macros

macro inspect(expr: untyped): untyped =
  echo treeRepr(expr)
  result = expr

inspect:
  let x = 10
  echo x
This macro prints the AST representation of the provided expression.

3. Custom DSLs
Metaprogramming enables the creation of custom domain-specific languages that can simplify complex tasks or tailor the language to specific domains.

Example: SQL DSL
nim
Copy code
import macros

macro query(q: untyped): untyped =
  let sql = q.toStrLit
  result = quote do:
    echo `sql`

query:
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18
This macro converts a custom query syntax into a SQL string.

4. Template System
Templates are another form of metaprogramming in Nim. They are similar to macros but are simpler and more limited in scope. Templates are expanded at compile time and can be used to inject code into other parts of the program.

Example: Simple Template
nim
Copy code
template max(a, b: untyped): untyped =
  if a > b: a else: b

echo max(5, 10)  # Output: 10
In this example, the max template injects the comparison logic into the calling code.

5. Compile-Time Evaluation
Nim allows certain expressions to be evaluated at compile time, which can improve performance and enable more complex metaprogramming techniques.

Example: Compile-Time Calculation
nim
Copy code
const factorial = block:
  var result = 1
  for i in 1..10:
    result *= i
  result

echo factorial  # Output: 3628800
In this example, the factorial constant is computed at compile time.

6. Integration with Other Features
Metaprogramming in Nim can be combined with other language features, such as generics and object-oriented programming, to create more powerful and flexible abstractions.

Example: Generic Macro
nim
Copy code
import macros

macro genAdd(T: typedesc): untyped =
  result = quote do:
    proc add(a, b: `T`): `T` =
      a + b

genAdd(int)
echo add(5, 10)  # Output: 15
This macro generates a generic add function for any type T.

7. Debugging and Testing
Metaprogramming can be complex, and debugging macros can be challenging. Nim provides tools and libraries to help with debugging and testing macros, such as macros.dumpTree and macros.dumpLisp.

Conclusion
Metaprogramming in Nim is a powerful feature that enables developers to create custom syntax, DSLs, and other advanced programming constructs. By leveraging macros, templates, and compile-time evaluation, developers can extend the language and tailor it to specific needs, making Nim a versatile and expressive language for a wide range of applications.

Expand:  Elegant Syntax

Nim's elegant syntax is designed to be clean, readable, and concise, making it easier to write and maintain code. The syntax is influenced by various programming languages, including Python, Ada, and Modula-3, and it encourages a functional programming style while still supporting imperative and object-oriented paradigms. Here's a more detailed exploration of Nim's elegant syntax:

1. Whitespace-Sensitive Indentation
Similar to Python, Nim uses indentation to delimit blocks of code. This helps to visually structure the code and reduce the need for explicit delimiters like braces or keywords.

Example:
nim
Copy code
proc greet(name: string) =
  echo "Hello, ", name

greet("World")
In this example, the indented block under the greet procedure defines the body of the procedure.

2. Concise and Readable Expressions
Nim's syntax is designed to be concise and readable, with a focus on reducing boilerplate code. This makes it easier to understand and maintain.

Example:
nim
Copy code
let numbers = @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let squared = numbers.map(proc(x: int): int = x * x)
echo squared  # Output: @[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
In this example, the map function is used to apply a lambda function to each element of the list, resulting in a concise and readable expression.

3. Functional Programming Constructs
Nim supports functional programming constructs, such as first-class functions, closures, and higher-order functions, which can make the code more expressive and concise.

Example:
nim
Copy code
proc add(a, b: int): int =
  a + b

let add5 = proc(x: int): int = add(x, 5)
echo add5(10)  # Output: 15
In this example, a lambda function add5 is created to add 5 to its argument, demonstrating the use of first-class functions.

4. Uniform Function Call Syntax
Nim supports uniform function call syntax (UFCS), which allows methods to be called using a consistent syntax, regardless of whether they are methods or standalone functions.

Example:
nim
Copy code
proc double(x: int): int =
  x * 2

let numbers = @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let doubled = numbers.map(double)
echo doubled  # Output: @[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
In this example, the double function is called using UFCS within the map function.

5. Type Inference
Nim's type inference system allows the compiler to deduce the types of variables and expressions, reducing the need for explicit type annotations and making the code more concise.

Example:
nim
Copy code
let x = 10  # x is inferred to be of type int
let y = "Hello"  # y is inferred to be of type string
echo x, " ", y  # Output: 10 Hello
In this example, the types of x and y are inferred by the compiler.

6. Syntactic Sugar
Nim provides syntactic sugar for common operations, making the code more readable and expressive.

Example:
nim
Copy code
let numbers = @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let sum = numbers.foldl(0, proc(acc, x: int): int = acc + x)
echo sum  # Output: 15
In this example, the foldl function is used with a lambda function to compute the sum of the list elements.

7. Error Handling
Nim uses exceptions for error handling, similar to many other languages. However, it also supports the Result type, which is useful for functional programming and ensuring that errors are handled explicitly.

Example:
nim
Copy code
proc divide(a, b: float): Result[float, string] =
  if b == 0.0:
    err("Division by zero")
  else:
    ok(a / b)

let result = divide(10.0, 2.0)
if result.isOk:
  echo result.get  # Output: 5.0
else:
  echo result.error
In this example, the divide function returns a Result type to handle potential errors.

Conclusion
Nim's elegant syntax is designed to be clean, readable, and concise, making it easier to write and maintain code. By leveraging whitespace-sensitive indentation, functional programming constructs, type inference, and syntactic sugar, Nim encourages a style that is both expressive and efficient. This makes Nim an attractive choice for developers looking for a modern, high-performance language with a pleasant syntax.

Expand: Interoperability

Interoperability is a key feature of Nim, allowing it to seamlessly interact with other programming languages and systems. This capability enables developers to leverage existing libraries, frameworks, and tools while taking advantage of Nim's performance, safety, and expressiveness. Here's a more detailed exploration of Nim's interoperability features:

1. C and C++ Interoperability
Nim can interoperate with C and C++ libraries, making it possible to use existing C and C++ code in Nim projects. This is achieved through the use of foreign function interfaces (FFI) and the ability to compile Nim code into C or C++ compatible code.

Example: Calling a C Function from Nim
nim
Copy code
# C code (example.c)
#include <stdio.h>

void greet(const char* name) {
  printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}
nim
Copy code
# Nim code (main.nim)
proc greet(name: cstring) {.importc, header: "example.h".}

greet("World")
In this example, the greet function from a C library is called from Nim using the importc pragma.

2. JavaScript Interoperability
Nim can compile to JavaScript, allowing it to run in web browsers and interact with JavaScript libraries and APIs. This makes Nim suitable for web development and enables the use of Nim's powerful features in the browser.

Example: Calling a JavaScript Function from Nim
nim
Copy code
# Nim code (main.nim)
proc alert(msg: cstring) {.importjs: "alert(#)".}

alert("Hello, World!")
In this example, the alert function from JavaScript is called from Nim using the importjs pragma.

3. Python Interoperability
Nim can interoperate with Python through the nimpy library, allowing developers to call Python functions from Nim and vice versa. This enables the use of Python's extensive libraries and ecosystem in Nim projects.

Example: Calling a Python Function from Nim
nim
Copy code
# Nim code (main.nim)
import nimpy

let os = pyImport("os")
echo os.getcwd()
In this example, the getcwd function from the Python os module is called from Nim using the nimpy library.

4. Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
Nim's FFI allows it to call functions from other languages and expose Nim functions to be called by other languages. This is achieved through pragmas that specify how the function should be imported or exported.

Example: Exporting a Nim Function to C
nim
Copy code
# Nim code (main.nim)
proc add(a, b: cint): cint {.exportc.} =
  a + b
c
Copy code
// C code (main.c)
#include <stdio.h>

extern int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
  printf("%d\n", add(5, 10));  // Output: 15
  return 0;
}
In this example, the add function is exported from Nim to C using the exportc pragma.

5. Dynamic Linking
Nim supports dynamic linking, allowing it to load and use shared libraries at runtime. This enables the use of dynamically loaded libraries and plugins in Nim projects.

Example: Loading a Shared Library at Runtime
nim
Copy code
# Nim code (main.nim)
import dynlib

type AddProc = proc(a, b: cint): cint {.cdecl.}

let lib = loadLib("example.dll")
if lib != nil:
  let add = cast[AddProc](lib.symAddr("add"))
  if add != nil:
    echo add(5, 10)  # Output: 15
  unloadLib(lib)
In this example, a shared library is loaded at runtime, and the add function is called from Nim.

6. C Macro Support
Nim supports C macros through the include statement, allowing it to include and use C header files directly. This enables the use of C macros and preprocessor directives in Nim code.

Example: Including a C Header File
c
Copy code
// C code (example.h)
#define PI 3.141592653589793
nim
Copy code
# Nim code (main.nim)
include example

echo PI  # Output: 3.141592653589793
In this example, the PI macro from a C header file is included and used in Nim.

7. Interop with Other Languages
Nim can interoperate with other languages through various mechanisms, such as network protocols, message passing, and shared memory. This enables distributed computing and communication between different systems and languages.

Conclusion
Nim's interoperability features make it a versatile language that can seamlessly interact with other programming languages and systems. By leveraging C and C++ interoperability, JavaScript compilation, Python interoperability, FFI, dynamic linking, and C macro support, developers can integrate Nim into existing projects and ecosystems, taking advantage of its performance, safety, and expressiveness. This makes Nim an attractive choice for developers looking to extend their existing toolsets and leverage the strengths of multiple programming languages.

Expand: Concurrency

Concurrency is a fundamental aspect of modern software development, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Nim provides robust support for concurrency and parallelism, making it easier to write efficient and responsive applications. Here's a more detailed exploration of concurrency in Nim:

1. Threads
Nim supports traditional OS threads, which are managed by the operating system and can run on multiple CPU cores. Threads in Nim are created using the thread keyword and can communicate with each other using channels.

Example: Creating and Running Threads
nim
Copy code
import threadpool

proc task(id: int) =
  echo "Task ", id, " started"
  sleep(1000)
  echo "Task ", id, " finished"

for i in 0..3:
  spawn task(i)

sync()
In this example, four tasks are spawned as separate threads, and the sync call ensures that the main thread waits for all tasks to complete.

2. Channels
Channels are a synchronization mechanism in Nim that allow threads to communicate and exchange data safely. Channels can be used to send and receive messages between threads, ensuring thread safety and avoiding race conditions.

Example: Using Channels for Communication
nim
Copy code
import threadpool

var chan = newChannel[int](1)

proc producer() =
  for i in 0..4:
    chan.send(i)
    echo "Produced: ", i

proc consumer() =
  while true:
    let value = chan.recv()
    echo "Consumed: ", value

spawn producer()
spawn consumer()

sync()
In this example, a producer thread sends integers to a consumer thread through a channel.

3. Async and Await
Nim provides asynchronous programming support through the async and await keywords. Asynchronous procedures can be suspended and resumed, allowing the program to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

Example: Asynchronous Programming
nim
Copy code
import asyncdispatch

proc asyncTask(id: int): Future[void] {.async.} =
  echo "Async Task ", id, " started"
  await sleepAsync(1000)
  echo "Async Task ", id, " finished"

proc main() {.async.} =
  await asyncTask(1)
  await asyncTask(2)

waitFor main()
In this example, two asynchronous tasks are executed concurrently using the async and await keywords.

4. Parallelism
Nim supports parallelism through the parallel block, which allows multiple tasks to be executed in parallel on multiple CPU cores. The parallel block ensures that the tasks are executed concurrently and efficiently.

Example: Parallel Execution
nim
Copy code
import parallel

proc task(id: int) =
  echo "Parallel Task ", id, " started"
  sleep(1000)
  echo "Parallel Task ", id, " finished"

parallel:
  for i in 0..3:
    spawn task(i)
In this example, four tasks are executed in parallel using the parallel block.

5. Atomic Operations
Nim provides atomic operations through the atomics module, which allows safe and efficient concurrent access to shared data. Atomic operations ensure that data is accessed and modified in a thread-safe manner, avoiding race conditions.

Example: Atomic Operations
nim
Copy code
import atomics

var counter = newAtomic[int](0)

proc increment() =
  for i in 0..999:
    atomicInc(counter)

proc decrement() =
  for i in 0..999:
    atomicDec(counter)

spawn increment()
spawn decrement()

sync()

echo "Counter: ", counter.load()  # Output: Counter: 0
In this example, two threads increment and decrement an atomic counter safely.

6. Lock-Free Data Structures
Nim provides lock-free data structures through the locks module, which allows concurrent access to shared data without the need for traditional locks. Lock-free data structures can improve performance and scalability in highly concurrent environments.

Example: Lock-Free Data Structures
nim
Copy code
import locks

var queue = initLockFreeQueue[int]()

proc producer() =
  for i in 0..999:
    queue.push(i)

proc consumer() =
  while true:
    let value = queue.pop()
    if value.isNone:
      break
    echo "Consumed: ", value.get()

spawn producer()
spawn consumer()

sync()
In this example, a lock-free queue is used to safely exchange data between a producer and a consumer thread.

Conclusion
Nim's concurrency features make it a powerful language for developing efficient and responsive applications. By leveraging threads, channels, asynchronous programming, parallelism, atomic operations, and lock-free data structures, developers can create concurrent programs that scale and perform well in modern computing environments. Nim's support for concurrency and parallelism ensures that developers can take advantage of multi-core processors and I/O-bound operations, making it an attractive choice for a wide range of applications.

Expand: Lock-Free Data Structures

Lock-free data structures are a type of concurrent data structure that allows multiple threads to access and modify the data concurrently without the need for traditional locks. Instead of using locks, lock-free data structures rely on atomic operations and careful memory ordering to ensure thread safety and avoid deadlocks, livelocks, and other concurrency issues. Lock-free data structures can provide better performance and scalability in highly concurrent environments.

Key Concepts
Atomic Operations: These are low-level operations that can be performed atomically, meaning they appear to execute instantaneously from the perspective of other threads. Examples include compare-and-swap (CAS), fetch-and-add, and load/store operations with specific memory ordering.

Memory Ordering: This refers to the order in which memory operations appear to execute from the perspective of different threads. Proper memory ordering ensures that the data structure behaves correctly under concurrent access.

Linearizability: This is a property of concurrent data structures where each operation appears to take effect instantaneously at some point between its invocation and completion. Linearizability ensures that the data structure behaves as if it were sequentially consistent.

Common Lock-Free Data Structures
Lock-Free Queue: A queue that allows multiple threads to enqueue and dequeue elements concurrently without using locks. The most common implementation uses a linked list with atomic operations to ensure thread safety.

Lock-Free Stack: A stack that allows multiple threads to push and pop elements concurrently without using locks. The most common implementation uses a linked list with atomic operations to ensure thread safety.

Lock-Free Hash Table: A hash table that allows multiple threads to insert, delete, and lookup elements concurrently without using locks. The most common implementation uses atomic operations and fine-grained locking to ensure thread safety.

Lock-Free List: A linked list that allows multiple threads to insert, delete, and traverse elements concurrently without using locks. The most common implementation uses atomic operations and careful memory ordering to ensure thread safety.

Example: Lock-Free Queue in Nim
Here's an example of a simple lock-free queue implemented in Nim:

nim
Copy code
import atomics

type
  Node[T] = object
    value: T
    next: AtomicPtr[Node[T]]

  LockFreeQueue[T] = object
    head: AtomicPtr[Node[T]]
    tail: AtomicPtr[Node[T]]

proc initLockFreeQueue[T](): LockFreeQueue[T] =
  let dummy = cast[ptr Node[T]](alloc0(sizeof(Node[T])))
  result.head.store(dummy, moRelaxed)
  result.tail.store(dummy, moRelaxed)

proc destroyLockFreeQueue[T](queue: var LockFreeQueue[T]) =
  var node = queue.head.load(moRelaxed)
  while node != nil:
    let next = node.next.load(moRelaxed)
    dealloc(node)
    node = next

proc push[T](queue: var LockFreeQueue[T], value: T) =
  let newNode = cast[ptr Node[T]](alloc0(sizeof(Node[T])))
  newNode.value = value
  newNode.next.store(nil, moRelaxed)

  var tail: ptr Node[T]
  while true:
    tail = queue.tail.load(moAcquire)
    let next = tail.next.load(moAcquire)
    if tail == queue.tail.load(moAcquire):
      if next == nil:
        if tail.next.compareExchange(next, newNode, moRelease, moRelaxed):
          break
      else:
        queue.tail.compareExchange(tail, next, moRelease, moRelaxed)
  queue.tail.compareExchange(tail, newNode, moRelease, moRelaxed)

proc pop[T](queue: var LockFreeQueue[T]): Option[T] =
  while true:
    let head = queue.head.load(moAcquire)
    var tail = queue.tail.load(moAcquire)
    var next = head.next.load(moAcquire)

    if head == queue.head.load(moAcquire):
      if head == tail:
        if next == nil:
          return none(T)
        queue.tail.compareExchange(tail, next, moRelease, moRelaxed)
      else:
        let value = next.value
        if queue.head.compareExchange(head, next, moRelease, moRelaxed):
          dealloc(head)
          return some(value)

var queue = initLockFreeQueue[int]()

proc producer() =
  for i in 0..999:
    queue.push(i)

proc consumer() =
  while true:
    let value = queue.pop()
    if value.isNone:
      break
    echo "Consumed: ", value.get()

import threadpool

spawn producer()
spawn consumer()

sync()

destroyLockFreeQueue(queue)
In this example, a lock-free queue is implemented using atomic operations and careful memory ordering to ensure thread safety. The push and pop operations allow multiple threads to enqueue and dequeue elements concurrently without using locks.

Benefits of Lock-Free Data Structures
Scalability: Lock-free data structures can scale better in highly concurrent environments because they avoid the contention and overhead associated with traditional locks.

Performance: Lock-free data structures can provide better performance by reducing the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks and by allowing more fine-grained control over memory ordering.

Reliability: Lock-free data structures can improve reliability by avoiding issues associated with traditional locks, such as deadlocks, livelocks, and priority inversion.

Challenges of Lock-Free Data Structures
Complexity: Implementing lock-free data structures can be complex and error-prone, requiring a deep understanding of atomic operations and memory ordering.

Debugging: Debugging lock-free data structures can be challenging because the behavior of the data structure can depend on the exact timing and ordering of operations.

Memory Management: Proper memory management is crucial in lock-free data structures to avoid memory leaks and ensure that memory is deallocated safely.

Conclusion
Lock-free data structures are a powerful tool for developing highly concurrent and scalable applications. By leveraging atomic operations and careful memory ordering, lock-free data structures can provide thread safety and avoid the issues associated with traditional locks. While implementing lock-free data structures can be complex and challenging, the benefits in terms of performance, scalability, and reliability make them an attractive choice for modern software development.

Generate lock-free data structures lexer/parser for Nim generated code using Nim.

Creating a lexer and parser for lock-free data structures in Nim involves several steps. First, we need to define the grammar for the language that describes lock-free data structures. Then, we can create a lexer to tokenize the input string and a parser to interpret these tokens according to the grammar.

```
Step 1: Define the Grammar
For simplicity, let's define a basic grammar for describing lock-free data structures. The grammar will support defining a lock-free queue with push and pop operations.

Copy code
program         ::= declaration*
declaration     ::= "queue" IDENTIFIER "{" operation* "}"
operation       ::= "push" expression ";"
                  | "pop" ";"
expression      ::= INTEGER
                  | IDENTIFIER
Step 2: Create the Lexer
The lexer will tokenize the input string according to the defined grammar.

nim
Copy code
type
  TokenKind = enum
    tkQueue, tkIdentifier, tkPush, tkPop, tkInteger, tkLBrace, tkRBrace, tkSemicolon, tkEof

  Token = object
    kind: TokenKind
    value: string

proc initToken(kind: TokenKind, value: string): Token =
  Token(kind: kind, value: value)

proc lexer(input: string): seq[Token] =
  var tokens: seq[Token] = @[]
  var i = 0

  while i < input.len:
    case input[i]
    of ' ', '\t', '\n', '\r':
      inc i
    of 'q':
      if input[i..i+4] == "queue":
        tokens.add(initToken(tkQueue, "queue"))
        inc i, 5
      else:
        raise newException(ValueError, "Unexpected character")
    of 'p':
      if input[i..i+3] == "push":
        tokens.add(initToken(tkPush, "push"))
        inc i, 4
      else:
        raise newException(ValueError, "Unexpected character")
    of 'o':
      if input[i..i+2] == "pop":
        tokens.add(initToken(tkPop, "pop"))
        inc i, 3
      else:
        raise newException(ValueError, "Unexpected character")
    of '{':
      tokens.add(initToken(tkLBrace, "{"))
      inc i
    of '}':
      tokens.add(initToken(tkRBrace, "}"))
      inc i
    of ';':
      tokens.add(initToken(tkSemicolon, ";"))
      inc i
    of '0'..'9':
      var num = ""
      while i < input.len and input[i] in '0'..'9':
        num.add(input[i])
        inc i
      tokens.add(initToken(tkInteger, num))
    of 'a'..'z', 'A'..'Z':
      var ident = ""
      while i < input.len and input[i] in 'a'..'z' or input[i] in 'A'..'Z':
        ident.add(input[i])
        inc i
      tokens.add(initToken(tkIdentifier, ident))
    else:
      raise newException(ValueError, "Unexpected character")

  tokens.add(initToken(tkEof, ""))
  return tokens
Step 3: Create the Parser
The parser will interpret the tokens according to the defined grammar and generate the corresponding Nim code for the lock-free data structure.

nim
Copy code
type
  Parser = object
    tokens: seq[Token]
    pos: int

proc initParser(tokens: seq[Token]): Parser =
  Parser(tokens: tokens, pos: 0)

proc current(p: Parser): Token =
  p.tokens[p.pos]

proc consume(p: var Parser, kind: TokenKind): Token =
  let token = p.current()
  if token.kind == kind:
    inc p.pos
    return token
  else:
    raise newException(ValueError, "Unexpected token")

proc parseExpression(p: var Parser): string =
  let token = p.current()
  if token.kind == tkInteger:
    p.consume(tkInteger)
    return token.value
  elif token.kind == tkIdentifier:
    p.consume(tkIdentifier)
    return token.value
  else:
    raise newException(ValueError, "Unexpected token")

proc parseOperation(p: var Parser): string =
  let token = p.current()
  if token.kind == tkPush:
    p.consume(tkPush)
    let expr = p.parseExpression()
    p.consume(tkSemicolon)
    return fmt"queue.push({expr})"
  elif token.kind == tkPop:
    p.consume(tkPop)
    p.consume(tkSemicolon)
    return "discard queue.pop()"
  else:
    raise newException(ValueError, "Unexpected token")

proc parseDeclaration(p: var Parser): string =
  p.consume(tkQueue)
  let name = p.consume(tkIdentifier).value
  p.consume(tkLBrace)
  var operations: seq[string] = @[]
  while p.current().kind != tkRBrace:
    operations.add(p.parseOperation())
  p.consume(tkRBrace)
  return fmt"""
var {name} = initLockFreeQueue[int]()
{operations.join("\n")}
"""

proc parseProgram(p: var Parser): string =
  var declarations: seq[string] = @[]
  while p.current().kind != tkEof:
    declarations.add(p.parseDeclaration())
  return declarations.join("\n")

proc parse(input: string): string =
  let tokens = lexer(input)
  var parser = initParser(tokens)
  return parser.parseProgram()
Step 4: Generate Nim Code
Finally, we can use the lexer and parser to generate Nim code for the lock-free data structure.

nim
Copy code
let input = """
queue myQueue {
  push 1;
  push 2;
  pop;
  push 3;
}
"""

let nimCode = parse(input)
echo nimCode
Full Example
Here is the complete example combining the lexer, parser, and code generation:

nim
Copy code
import strformat
