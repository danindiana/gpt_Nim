**Project Title:** Grimlock

**Project Description:**
Grimlock is a high-performance, lock-free data structure library for Nim language, designed to leverage CUDA for accelerated processing. The library will focus on providing efficient lexer/parser functionalities, enabling developers to process large datasets with minimal latency and overhead.

**Objective:**
To create a Nim library that integrates CUDA for parallel processing, offering lock-free data structures and efficient lexer/parser capabilities for handling complex data parsing tasks.

**Key Features:**
1. **Lock-Free Data Structures:** Implement lock-free data structures to ensure thread safety and high concurrency without the overhead of locks.
2. **CUDA Integration:** Utilize NVIDIA's CUDA platform to offload computationally intensive tasks to GPU, significantly boosting performance.
3. **Lexer/Parser:** Develop a robust lexer/parser module capable of handling various data formats and parsing rules efficiently.
4. **Modular Design:** Organize the library into modular components for easy maintenance, extensibility, and integration with other projects.
5. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the library for maximum throughput and minimal latency, suitable for real-time data processing applications.

**Technologies and Tools:**
- **Nim Language:** Primary programming language for developing the library.
- **CUDA Toolkit:** For GPU acceleration and parallel computing.
